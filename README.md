# Dictionary-using-Python
Created a simple dictionary using Json and Python
Downloaded the json file which stores all the words and their meanings and the python program takes our input and searches for a match in the json file.
If found it returns its meaning
If not found it says word not found.

To run this, download both the files (.json and .py) in the same directory and then run the python program.
